# Soulforged 0.2.0 - You Can Actually Attack Now Edition
## NOTE: Soulforged is still in the EARLY ALPHA phase, there will be bugs!

### Additions
- Added Soulforged Combat Debugger. Access this by swapping fabric.mod.json with fabric.mod.scd.json in the jar.
- Added attack damage. Weapons actually work as weapons now. What a concept!
- Added Single, Double, and Hold click attacks. Hold for 10 frames/click twice or more within 10 frames to activate these special attacks.
- Added Forward Crits. Other crit directions still in development.
- Added Slashing, Thrusting, and Crushing crits. Depending on the weapon type, these crits will be applied.
- Added sound effects. Currently the only indication of which crit category is being used.
### Changes
- Probably a few
### Removals

### Patches
- Several, so many that I genuinely don't remember. Maybe I should set up a bug tracker...
